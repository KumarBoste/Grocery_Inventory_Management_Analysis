## Project Overview

The Grocery Inventory Management Analysis project is a Power BI dashboard designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize inventory performance in a grocery retail environment.
It helps stakeholders track stock levels, identify reorder risks, analyze category-wise inventory distribution, and improve overall inventory turnover efficiency.

## Project Objectives
- Monitor total inventory quantity and value
- Identify products below reorder level
- Analyze monthly and quarterly stock trends
- Track category-wise inventory distribution
- Evaluate inventory status (Active, Backordered, Discontinued)
- Improve inventory turnover and replenishment decisions

## Business Problem
Grocery retailers often face challenges such as:
- Stockouts of high-demand products
- Overstocking leading to increased holding costs
- Poor visibility into reorder requirements
- Inefficient inventory turnover

This project addresses these issues by providing real-time, visual, and actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Key KPIs
- Total Stock Quantity: 21,229
- Total Stock Value: 126.31K
- Products Below Reorder Level: 186
- Average Inventory Turnover Ratio: 51.11

## Dashboard Features & Insights
#### Inventory Overview
- High-level KPIs summarizing stock health
- Quick visibility into reorder risks and inventory value

#### Total Stock by Month / Quarter
- Trend analysis to identify seasonal demand patterns
- Helps optimize procurement and stocking cycles

#### Total Stock by Category
- Category-wise comparison of stock quantity vs reorder level
- Identifies high-risk and overstocked categories

#### Inventory Status Distribution
- Breakdown of:
  - Active Inventory
  - Backordered Products
  - Discontinued Items
  - Supports catalog optimization decisions

#### Product-Level Stock Status
- Detailed table with:
  - Product name
  - Category
  - Total stock quantity
  - Reorder level
  - Stock status indicator (Safety Stock / Need Reorder)

## Statistical Analysis
- Aggregations (SUM, COUNT)
- Time-series analysis (monthly & quarterly)
- Ratio analysis (Inventory Turnover)
- Threshold-based classification (Reorder vs Safety Stock)

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Power Query
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Microsoft Excel (Data Source)

## Key Recommendations
- Implement automated reorder alerts
- Maintain buffer stock for fast-moving categories
- Improve supplier coordination for backordered items
- Optimize discontinued inventory to reduce storage costs
- Use historical trends for seasonal demand forecasting

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard transforms raw inventory data into meaningful business insights.
It enables grocery retailers to:
- Reduce stockouts
- Minimize overstocking
- Improve inventory turnover
- Make data-driven replenishment decisions

The project demonstrates strong skills in data modeling, DAX, visualization design, and business analysis.
